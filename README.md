A bunch of LeetCode solutions in Rust.


## How To Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BenSparksCode/rust-leetcode.git
cd rust-leetcode
```

### 2. Workspace Setup

This project is structured as a Rust workspace. Each problem is a separate crate inside the problems/ folder, following the naming convention `pXXXX_problem_name`.

For example:

```
problems/
â”œâ”€â”€ p0001_two_sum
â”œâ”€â”€ p0002_add_two_numbers
â””â”€â”€ p0003_longest_substring_without_repeating_characters
```

### 3. Run the Tests

There are unit tests for each problem. You can run them either per individual problem or all at once.

**Run tests for all problems:**

```bash
cargo test
```

**Run tests for a specific problem:**

```bash
cargo test -p p0001_two_sum
```
